Keypoint RCNN ResNet50 in Torch:

Input: Tensor (representing an image)
Output: List[Dict] (each dictionary corresponds to a detected object in the image and contains information such as the bounding box coordinates and the keypoints of the object)


Semantic Segmentation model with ResNet50 in Torch:

Input: Tensor (representing an image)
Output: Tensor (of the same size as the input image, where each pixel is assigned a label corresponding to the class of the object it belongs to)
